\f0\fs24 \cf2 To get one way binding:\
\
1. I made stored properties with that change view values every time its values are set\
\
To get two way binding:\
\
1. I can IBAction certain events, for example for textfield it would be editChange. That would reset the stored property, which would then change the view\'92s value.\
\
\
Failed Attempt: \
\
1. Make a generic binding function that\'92ll take any uiview\
\
2. The uiview\'92s text/value property will be contained in an object, and its methods will be used when assigning values\
\
3. The observer didset will fire every time its set to a new value, which will update the view element}
