\f0\fs24 \cf0 Apple\'92s Human Interface Guidelines outline general ways to make your app more user friendly and engaging. It has guidelines ranging from which colors to choose from to ideal times for requesting a review/rating from a user. Many of the system provided features such as the status bar and the review/rating prompt are ideal choices because they are the least likely to confuse user by giving them a different experience. Review requests should also be spaced out between 1 or 2 week intervals so users don\'92t feel bombarded by review requests. There should be occasional tips and entertaining graphics during launch screens so that they aren\'92t aware how long it\'92s taking to load the app, and instructional screens should be skippable so users can jump right into the content if they please. The system should be used to inquire information about the user rather than having them enter them manually. For example, a zip code should be retrieved from their current location permission rather than directly asking them to type in their zip code. \

The App Store Review Guidelines are more strict than the Human Interface Guidelines because it covers issues related to ethics, functionality, and monetizing rather than just making pleasing user interfaces, fortunately much of it is intuitive. Apps shouldn\'92t have offensive content or exploit their users information somehow or they risk being removed from the Developer program. Apps submitted to the App Store must be completed, not in beta, and their descriptions and pictures in the App Store must accurately reflect their experience. Users must be made aware whenever anything is recorded, for example by their camera or whatever action they make. Apps should be useful, unique, or \'93app-like\'94 so that they don\'92t clutter the App Store and make it harder for users to find good apps. They shouldn\'92t simply look like repackaged websites, or users may not be tempted to use the App. Apps in the Kids category may not have links outside of the app, purchasing opportunities, or other directions unless they\'92re in a designated area behind a parental gate. Even if an App deselects the kids Category, it must still follow these same requirements with subsequent updates. }
